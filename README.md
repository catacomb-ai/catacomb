## Usage

### Installation

Catacomb's Python library can be installed from the PyPi registry:

```
pip install catacomb-ai
```

To test installation, run `catacomb`:

```
Usage: catacomb [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build
  push
  run
```

### Required Files

The only file Catacomb expects is a `system.py` file that implements a class containing the `__init__` and `output` methods:

```python
import catacomb

class UppercaseModel:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initializing system and loading dependencies"""
        self.variable = True

    def output(self, input):
        """Performing inference and returning a prediction"""
        return input.upper()
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    catacomb.connect(UppercaseModel, 'TEXT')
```

Implementing the system interface allows Catacomb to auto-generate a UI for the system/model from the command line tool. Model hosting will fail unless all dependencies are defined within the current directory (i.e. a `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt` file is required).

Running Catacomb locally can be done by running `python system.py`. 

### Deployment
Catacomb's build process requires that Docker is both already installed on the local machine, and 
the client is logged into a Docker account (for pushing images to the Docker registry). 

Deployment to Catacomb hosting can be done with the following commands:

1. `catacomb build`
2. `catacomb push`

Include dependencies for `system.py` in a `Pipfile` and corresponding `Pipfile.lock` if using [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), or in a `requirements.txt` file. 

Run `catacomb upload` to deploy the model to Catacomb's hosting service.

```
âžœ catacomb upload
Image name: example
ðŸ¤–: Uploading your model image (this may take a while so you might wanna grab some coffee â˜•)...
```

This will install any packages specified in the `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt` onto the Docker image and copy all contents of the current directory to the image, as well as pushing to the public Docker container registry.

#### External Dependencies
Additional external dependencies can be installed by specifying a `catacomb.sh` bash file to run on the created image. This file is detected during the `catacomb build` process.
