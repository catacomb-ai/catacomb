# Catacomb Guide
> Building machine learning is hard. Using it shouldn't be.

## Quickstart

This guide will take roughly 10 - 15 minutes to get you up and running with Catacomb!


We recommend using a *cloud training platform* like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run this demonstration. However, Catacomb fully supports any operating system and runtime, so feel free to use your own computer as well!

### Generate a User Interface

The easiest way to get started with Catacomb is to launch a user interface for an existing local model.

Let's start with a sentiment analysis model - a powerful and fun application of natural language processing. In this guide, we will be relying on a pre-trained model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english).
